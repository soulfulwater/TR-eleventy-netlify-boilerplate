  "text": "We have a big problem with the understanding of financial products.<br/><br/>Why is it made so difficult for families to understand how they need to prepare, protect and plan for their future?<br/><br/>After becoming a Mum, I realised how many of my friends didn’t feel confidence in budgeting, paying off debts, being mortgage ready or planning for if the worst was to happen.<br/><br/>I’m now using my 20 years experience of working in financial services to make having a finanical plan easy for any family, no matter the situation or income.<br/><br/>My Family Finances was born from the belief that high quality financial advice and education should not be restricted to a small percentage of the UK population but an essential service which should be accessible to the everyone.",
